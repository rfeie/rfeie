ðŸŽ¶Itâ€™s been a while ðŸŽ¶<!--more--> since I have posted! But I have a good reason:
in mid-February I accepted a full-time position as a Front End Developer. Since
then I have been focusing my energy on learning all I can about the ecosystem. 

Now I am getting back into blogging into the void. Here are some things you can
look forward ti hearing from me on in the future:

- Updates on what I have been learning and reading 
- What I have been working on.
- Blog redesign using [gatsby][https://www.gatsbyjs.org/] 

Soon I will be talking about my new project using React and Electron to build a
Menu bar app.

Talk to you soon!
