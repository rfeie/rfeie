[JavaScript Jabber][javascript-jabber] Weekly iteration on testing APIs

This was a piece of advice about how to find an open source project to create. Find an aspect of the envrionment you work in that noone seems to pay enough attention to and then become the expert on it. This might sound relatively obvious but this line jumped out at me because it calls for focus and care. You not only figure out the need but focus on it and spend your time understanding it's ins and outs. This is related to a [blog post][care-alot] I read recently about mastering the domains that are central to your product.
