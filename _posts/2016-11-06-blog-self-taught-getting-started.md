This is part one of a series of posts focusing on the constant process of learning as a self-taught programmer. <!--more-->

First let me give you my background. I am a self-taught web developer focused on Ruby on 
Rails and React. I first started learning through MOOCs about anything under the
sun (Python, Android, Node, SQL) but I eventually focused on learning web
development with a focus on Ruby on Rails and React.

This first blog post is speaking from the perspective as you first begin to learn.
When you have decided that you want to pursue learning more about programming,  you may have decided what you want to focus on or you are still looking to
learn.

### Learning
Now that you want to learn lets give you a couple places to start with:

- [ Coursera ][ coursera ](Free, mostly) - One of the leaders of MOOCs (Massive Open Online
  Courses). Classes are free but Coursera offers 'certifications' that are
  chained together courses for a specific field (like web development). This is
  a great place to start as they have courses that are aimed at the very
  beginner then you can transition to a specialization or more advanced topics.
- [ Codecademy ][ codecademy ](Free)- Another provider of online courses. Codecademy
  is very useful when you are first starting. Many of the courses assume little
  to no prior knowledge and have an interactive element and step-by-step process
  that is very helpful when you are first learning the basics of programming.
- [ Pluralsight ][ pluralsight ](Subscription) - Pluralsight is more focused on
  existing developers but has recently implemented 'Paths' that allow you to
  choose a specific language and watch a curated list of courses aimed at
  bringing you up to speed.
- [ The Odin Project ][ the-odin-project ](Free) - Focused on Ruby on Rails and
  JavaScript this resource is an aggregation of open source resources aimed at
  bringing you up to speed as a web developer. I went through every path on this
  with the exception of JavaScript and found it to be invaluable. They spend a
  good amount of attention on aspects a single course or video may not focus on.
  Such as Git, computer science concepts and testing.
- [ Udacity ][ udacity ](Free and paid courses) - Listed last as I have never
  used Udacity but I have heard good things and it has been on my 'To do' list
  to look into their nano degrees. Udacity has a mix of free courses and nano
  degree programs aimed at teaching you a specific skill.


### Give yourself a project
Once you have started learning my best advice to you would be to give yourself a
project. If there is one thing I learned nothing is more valuable than giving
yourself a project to focus on.

Depending on the path this could be something as simple as the front-end to a
website in JavaScript, or a command line game in Ruby or Java. The important
part in my mind is having to write it yourself without an external source
guiding you along. You will natually make more mistakes and catch more bugs as
you start to build the mental muscles of visualizing ideas in code.

### Tips
Some quick tips as you get started:

- Create a [ Github ][ github ] account. Using Github to centrally store all of
  your code will be useful and get you used to using git
- Keep a schedule you reliably work every day. I use the [Productive
  App][ productive ] to have a list of learning and development goals to hit every
  day to keep me on track.
- Podcasts: Start listening to tech podcasts. I have found that even when I may
  not know exactly what they are talking about actually hearing people discuss
  programming is great and you start to build a mental model of programming
  concepts outside your immediate sphere.
- Start attending [Meetups][ meetup ]. These are great to meet people in your
  community but they also expose you to new ideas and concepts you may not run
  into on your own.

### Conclusion

That concludes part one. I look forward to communicating with you again on part
two. Happy Coding!
