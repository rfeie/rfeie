Good morning/afternoon/evening to whoever you are. 
Welcome to my new site. <!--more-->

If you have read my about page I am sure you know I am a self-taight programmer. And as I have started to learn more and travelled further off the tutorial-beaten-path I realized I can share some of the knowledge I am starting to accrue with the hope of benefitting someone, somewhere.

A couple notes about this site. This site is a staticly generated site written in Jekyll and hosted on [Github][site-repo]. I used the [Bourbon][bourbon] and [Neat][neat] as well as [Refills][refills] to scaffold it together. 

What you can expect from me in the near future:
* Updates on a Rails app that uses the Google Calendar API
* Updates on learning Angular 2 and a front-end JavaScript framework in general
* Work on updating Adobe InDesign JavaScript
