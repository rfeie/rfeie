    <h1>What I use</h1>

      First of all I want to credit <a href="http://wesbos.com/uses">Wes Bos</a> for the idea. This is generally the gear and tools I use at work and home. </p>

      I am currently using vim at work and on personal projects. I am by no means an
      expert at Vim but I am starting to get my .vimrc in order.

      I am using the <a

        Citizen Messenger bag</a>. The bag is functionally waterproof and even though I have had it for around 3-4 years the only signs of aging or wear is a patina of dirt.

      Standard MacBook Pro with Touch Bar. Boring. Nothing to see here.

      Okay, get ready. I try and use processes that help me break up tasks into smaller pieces
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Pomodoros: I use the <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique">pomodoro
          technique </a>when I am having a lot of trouble focusing.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://fieldnotesbrand.com/">Field Notes</a>: These are pocket
        sized notebooks that I like to use to have a physical to-do pad and a
        place to put day-to-day into.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="http://productiveapp.io/" target="_blank">Productive</a>: I use
        this to create daily/weekly tasks. This helps keep track of tasks I want
        to continue to do every day like spending time reading or learning a new
        technology.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://trello.com/">Trello</a>: What I use to manage my side
        projects and organize information and resources. One of the best free
        softwares. Well-designed and lightweight.
      </li>
    </ul>
