<h1>Field Notes</h1>
<p>Named after the <a href="https://fieldnotesbrand.com/">notebooks</a>, these are meant to be small ideas or quotes that jumped out at me while I was reading a book, listening to a podcast, browsing twitter or a blog article. <p>
<div class="cards">
  {% for post in site.posts  %}
    {% if post.type =="field-note"%}
      {% include card.html %}
    {% endif %}
  {% endfor %}
</div>
